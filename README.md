# Asambas

An ARMv7-M assembler in development for educational purposes, with a name dedicated to the original noir chapeau team called "Waiting For Samba".
The idea is to make something that works (most of the time) and forces me to learn about ARM assembly. So there is a lot of oversight in the name of progress because it's not meant to be commercial at all.

Breaking changes will be pushed often, until I feel the assembler is done.
